                    The song portrays the maturing of the relationship with my parents,
                    many times I didn't like being in my house and I didn't like my parents and I felt that
                    I didn't fit into that family, I tried to escape that reality that existed.
                    Over time I realized that relationships are actually difficult, 
                    we are all human and we make mistakes, this made me realize that sometimes 
                    it's better to let someone go than to get hurt.

                    I wrote lie after I had left a relationship that was dead for a long time.
                    It was the first relationship either one of us had been in and I think we knew we weren’t right for
                    each other but didn’t know how to fix it.
                    I kept trying to make it work as hard as I could because I was so scared of it ending.
                    I wanted it to work so desperately I was lying to the other person as well as myself.
                    As our relationship started to deteriorate I found companionship in strangers on
                    the internet.

                <p>
                    For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with body image.
                    I developed an eating disorder as a teenager and I’ve been living with it ever since.
                    I have always hated the way I looked and it’s gotten in the way of me living life.
                    I’ve missed out on a lot of things that should’ve been fun because I was too self-conscious.
                    If I see a bad photo of me or a video of me that I don’t like it won’t just ruin my day but it will 
                    become actually debilitating.
